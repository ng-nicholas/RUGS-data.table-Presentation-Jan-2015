# RUGS-data.table-Presentation-Jan-2015
### *By Gaurav Chaturedi & Nicholas Ng for RUGS*
Repo for material and powerpoint presentation used in RUGS meetup on 5 Jan 2015. These were the files used on a presentation on the data.table package.

## Guide to files:
- **RUGS dplyr vs data table Jan 2016.ppt**: Brief introduction slides and helpful links.
- **RUGS_dt.Rmd & .html**: Main markdown used during the presentation. Contains most of the examples.
- **RUGS_dt_extra.Rmd & .html**: Secondary markdown. Contains additional examples on appending data via `rbindlist` and joins. Also contains heavy duty benchmarking for all operations (some operations were benchmarked using `system.time` in the main markdown).
- **rugsdply.csv**: Dataset used for generating examples in the markdowns. Describes customer-property owner interactions for a rental website. *Bad News*: GH has a file limit of 100mb.
